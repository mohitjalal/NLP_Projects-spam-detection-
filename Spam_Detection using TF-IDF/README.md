## This is a Spam Detection Project using TF-IDF.
Steps:
1. Load the dataset using pandas.
2. Data Cleaning and preprocessing.
3. Train Test Split.
4. Converting sentence to vectors using TF-IDF technique.
5. Using machine learning algorithm to train the model.
6. Testing the model with a ham mail message.
7. Model predicts 1->spam and ->ham.
